# Panama-Canal-Bond-Research

This study investigates the price dynamics of Panama Canal Bonds issued in 1906, 1908, and 1911, focusing
on their behavior in relation to historical events and market conditions from the early 20th century. Using
quantitative economic methods, we analyze time series data and correlations to uncover the influence of World
War I and subsequent global economic fluctuations on bond prices. Our research reveals three key findings:
(1) the correlation between bond prices and historical events during World War I, (2) the divergence in bond
price behaviors over time and in response to various events, and (3) the differing trajectories of Panama Canal
Bonds compared to Railroad Bonds and Liberty Loans towards the end of World War I and the ensuing global
depression. These findings offer insights into the impact of geopolitical and economic factors on bond valuations
and contribute to understanding historical government debt issuance.

## Historical Overview of the Panama Canal Bonds:
The US began the conctruction of the Panama Canal on May 4th, 1904 and concluded it on August 15th, 1914. However, thie prokect was very expensive and they issued 4 series of bonds to finance it: The 1906, 1908, and 1911 series plus the conversion bonds.

1906: The Panama Canal Bond 2% (1906-36), to the highest bidder caused sales of Consol 2s (then quoted at 103.25) and the retirement of circulation accounts. The provision limiting the retirement to $3,000,000 per month prevented the market price of 2s from declining to par. To provide support, the Secretary called for $10,000,000 in special Government bonds and created a market demand for Panama 2s. The average price realized for the $30,000,000 Panama 2s of 1916-1936 was 104.036. To avoid a money stringency incident, all purchasing banks were permitted to retain one-third of the purchase money as Government deposits. This also had a stimulating effect on the price bids for the bonds. 

1908:  The $30,000,000 Panama Canal 2% bonds of 1918-38 offered in December were readily absorbed by the banks, and the Government bond market closed the year with all issues firm.

1911: The treasury offered $50,000,000 Panama Canal 3s, dated June 1, due in 50 years. The bids aggregated $212,085,200, and the average price realized was 102.5825. This produced a premium of $1,291,274 and made the Treasury’s actual interest rate of the transaction 2.9019%. Within a year after their issue, the Panama 3s sold as high as 103 ¼, and in 1945, thirty-four years later, they were quoted as high as 135 ½, yielding 0.65%, solely because they were fully tax-exempt.
