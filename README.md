# Panama-Canal-Bond-Research

This study investigates the price dynamics of Panama Canal Bonds issued in 1906, 1908, and 1911, focusing
on their behavior in relation to historical events and market conditions from the early 20th century. Using
quantitative economic methods, we analyze time series data and correlations to uncover the influence of World
War I and subsequent global economic fluctuations on bond prices. Our research reveals three key findings:
(1) the correlation between bond prices and historical events during World War I, (2) the divergence in bond
price behaviors over time and in response to various events, and (3) the differing trajectories of Panama Canal
Bonds compared to Railroad Bonds and Liberty Loans towards the end of World War I and the ensuing global
depression. These findings offer insights into the impact of geopolitical and economic factors on bond valuations
and contribute to understanding historical government debt issuance.

## Historical Overview of the Panama Canal Bonds:
The US began the conctruction of the Panama Canal on May 4th, 1904 and concluded it on August 15th, 1914. However, thie prokect was very expensive and they issued 4 series of bonds to finance it: The 1906, 1908, and 1911 series plus the conversion bonds.

1906: The Panama Canal Bond 2% (1906-36), to the highest bidder caused sales of Consol 2s (then quoted at 103.25) and the retirement of circulation accounts. The provision limiting the retirement to $3,000,000 per month prevented the market price of 2s from declining to par. To provide support, the Secretary called for $10,000,000 in special Government bonds and created a market demand for Panama 2s. The average price realized for the $30,000,000 Panama 2s of 1916-1936 was 104.036. To avoid a money stringency incident, all purchasing banks were permitted to retain one-third of the purchase money as Government deposits. This also had a stimulating effect on the price bids for the bonds. 

1908:  The $30,000,000 Panama Canal 2% bonds of 1918-38 offered in December were readily absorbed by the banks, and the Government bond market closed the year with all issues firm.

1911: The treasury offered $50,000,000 Panama Canal 3s, dated June 1, due in 50 years. The bids aggregated $212,085,200, and the average price realized was 102.5825. This produced a premium of $1,291,274 and made the Treasury’s actual interest rate of the transaction 2.9019%. Within a year after their issue, the Panama 3s sold as high as 103 ¼, and in 1945, thirty-four years later, they were quoted as high as 135 ½, yielding 0.65%, solely because they were fully tax-exempt.

## The Panama Canal Bonds and the Railroad Industry
We found this nice dataset which gives the monthly price for high grade American railroad company bonds during the period we are looking at with the Panama Canal for a comparison to a different class.(F.R. Macaulay, The Movement Of Interest Rates, Bond Yields, And Stock Prices In The United States Since 1856 (NBER, 1938)).
We found the relationship between the 1906 Series canal bond and the Railroad Bonds Index very interesting, because before the US Railroads got nationalized in December 1917, they were well correlated positively with the canal bond price. However, things get wonky during the nationalized time period, but then after 1924 they seem to have a certain level of negative correlation. 

# REVIEW THIS
In analyzing the fluctuations of the bond industry, we can see that the railroad industry and the three bond series have similar correlations, including the breakdown at the beginning of WWI. However, after 1917 only 1911 bond keeps this correlation with the railroad bond while the 1906 and 1908 remain constant. This proposes an interesting question in regards to what caused this divergence between the Panama Bonds. 

## Is the answer found in 1914?
The date the Secretary of the Treasury fixed for opening the Federal Reserve Banks for business was November 16th. The country had been divided into twelve districts for the early launching of the new system. The difficulties of the undertaking were aggravated by economic disturbances occasioned by WWI, which extended to every part of the country. 

Conditions of uncertainty and perplexity confronting the Board when it began its work in August had a considerable bearing on the policy pursued.  The outbreak of hostilities in Europe immediately led to a severe rupture of international financial relationships throughout the commercial world, involving the temporary breakdown of export trade and the collapse of the financial markets, resulting in a shock to the credit system. European holders of American securities sought to sell them in the New York Market, which was demoralized. Prices declined alarmingly rapidly, and the country was exposed to a severe and disastrous drain of gold. 

Additionally, on February 2nd, 1920, Davis F. Houston made a comment that gives some insight on the price divergence between railroad industry bonds and the Panama Bonds; however, this is not the full explanaition of the story:

The Liberty bonds and Victory notes were deeply affected because they were selling below par-value, but it seems that the Panama Canal 1906 bonds were different not only because of the divergent price paths but also because its construction was concluded in 1914, so this investment was going to be backed up by revenues from the Canal operations. Thus, amid economic distress, investors would favor a reliable revenue stream from the Panama Canal instead of an uncertain declining bond.

## Is the answer found in 1917?
There is no doubt that starting in 1914 WWI took great importance in the map and the new question for the United States was how to finance it. Furthermore, there were three main options the government could've taken given the new Federal Reserve that was established in 1913. (1) Raising taxes, (2) Borrowing from the public, and (3)printing money. As an earlier example, durng the civil war the governemnt had simply printed greenbacks but this was not fit because of the gold standard at the time. However, Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo thought that finance about 50% from taxes and 50% from bonds would work well. Thus, in October 1917 Congress responded to the call for higher taxes with the War Revenue Act. This act increased the personal and corporate income tax rates and established a new excercise, excess-profit, and luxuxry taxes. The tax rate for an income of $10,000 with four exemptions (about $140,000 in 2003 dollars) went from 1.2 percent in 1916 to 7.8 percent. For incomes of $1,000,000 the rate went from 10.3 percent in 1916 to 70.3 percent in 1918. These increase in taxes and the increase in nominal income raised revenues from $930 million in 1916 to $4,388 million in 1918. Federal expenditures, however, increased from $1,333 million in 1916 to $15,585 million in 1918. A huge gap had opened up that would have to be closed by borrowing. Thus, Liberty Bonds were created. 

## Did taxes directly affect the Panama Canal 1911 Bond?
Diving a little bit deeper into the specifics of the 1911 series Bond. It is interesting that wihtin a year after their issue date, the Panama 3s sold as high as 103.125 and thirty-four years later reached a high of 135.5, yielding .65%, solely because they were FULLY TAX-EXEMPT. In addition, the omission of the priviledge to use these bonds as a basis for national bank circulation put them squarely upon an investment basis. The story suggests that the rapid rise in taxes does not affect the price of the 1911 Bonds because they were tax extempt.
