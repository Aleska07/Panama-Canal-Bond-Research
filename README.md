# Panama-Canal-Bond-Research

This study investigates the price dynamics of Panama Canal Bonds issued in 1906, 1908, and 1911, focusing
on their behavior in relation to historical events and market conditions from the early 20th century. Using
quantitative economic methods, we analyze time series data and correlations to uncover the influence of World
War I and subsequent global economic fluctuations on bond prices. Our research reveals three key findings:
(1) the correlation between bond prices and historical events during World War I, (2) the divergence in bond
price behaviors over time and in response to various events, and (3) the differing trajectories of Panama Canal
Bonds compared to Railroad Bonds and Liberty Loans towards the end of World War I and the ensuing global
depression. These findings offer insights into the impact of geopolitical and economic factors on bond valuations
and contribute to understanding historical government debt issuance.
